### MINERTIMER SYSTEM FOR LIMITING CHILDRENS'S USE OF MINECRAFT ON MAC COMPUTERS

Apple's screentime system is of no use in limiting childrens' use of Minecraft (Java edition) on Macintosh computers. This project aims to fix that problem. 

This is a system developed by a parent developer for Soferio Pty Limited to allow technically skilled parents to limit Minecraft java edition use by a child on a macos system. It installs a background process which kills minecraft (even mid game) after 30 min of total use per day. A short sound will play when shutdown occurs. There is no warning prior to the 30min curfew.

## NO LIABILITY
But it depends on the reader being sufficiently technically skills to install and run scripts in 'Terminal'. If you do not have such competence, you will need to find a colleague to assist you because you can damage your system if you do not know what you are doing.
No liability accepted for any losses caused by use of code. Review code and use at own risk. No support is provided for the use of this code.

### INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

To install the system copy all files to a single directory and then go to terminal, go the directory where those files are located, and run "sudo zsh install_minertimer.sh".
